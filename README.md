# Scripting Languages — Labs (FER, 2024/2025)

This repository contains my work and notes for the course **Scripting Languages**. The course treats scripting as “glue” programming: composing complete solutions by combining existing tools and small scripts. I practice Unix shell scripting, regular expressions, standard Unix utilities, and introductory Perl/Python.

## What I focused on
- Writing portable **bash** scripts that accept CLI arguments and handle errors
- Using **grep/sed/awk/find**, pipelines, redirection, and job control to process files and logs
- Designing and testing **regular expressions** for realistic text tasks
- Implementing small **Python 3** programs for parsing, I/O, basic data processing, and simple networking
- Organizing code, input samples, and instructions so each lab is reproducible

## Repository structure
- `lab1/` — Unix tools, regex, and bash scripting (foundations)
- `lab2/` — Advanced shell automation and text/log processing
- `lab3/` — Python 3 exercises (files, parsing, basic networking)

Each lab folder has its own `README.md` with a short brief and the list of tasks.
